English: Capitalization in Titles
=================================

2016-11-02

My question at Slack in channel WriteTheDocs/General:

   "Let's say I (from de) want to write documentation for en_US. 
   What are the rules about what words should be capitalized in headlines? 
   Can you point me to some relevant information?"

From the answers:

-  here’s a short summary of the two common choices: 
   http://www.onlinegrammar.com.au/title-and-sentence-case/
   
-  an exhaustive description: 
   http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2012/03/title-case-and-sentence-case-capitalization-in-apa-style.html
   
-  "Based on a tiny bit of prior experience working with writers for whom English
   was not their primary language: if you don't have to match some existing style,
   I'd say the sentence case—capitalizing the first word and any proper nouns
   is a bit easier to explain to others and to maintain."
   
-  "If you're asking about software documentation, there's been a pretty strong 
   trend for a number of years away from title case for any sort of heading or title. 
   Again, my default favorite for writing for the web:"

-  .. tip::
   
      http://titlecapitalization.com/: Title Capitalization: Your Online Title Case Tool
      
-  "One frustrating trend that I’ve noticed is that enterprise website styles and support
   style guides use title case, and the tech docs rarely use it.
   This creates confusion when people are contributing to both."
   "True, marketing teams still love title case."
   
-  '''There are rules, but even native speakers get them wrong. 
   For example, "the" shouldn't be capitalized but I've seen 
   "How The Product Works" more than a few times. So even if you make a mistake, 
   you'll have plenty of company :) '''
